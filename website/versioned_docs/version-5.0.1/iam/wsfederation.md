# WS-Federation

The SimpleIdServer's [Identity Provider](../glossary) can act as a WS-Federation server.

The [WS-Federation Language](http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsfed/federation/v1.2/os/ws-federation-1.2-spec-os.html) version 1.2 is supported.

To create a website with WS-Federation support, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `Clients` page.
2. Click on the `Add client` button.
3. Select the `Standard` template and select the `WS-Federation Relyng party`, then click on the `Next` button.
4. Fill in the form with the appropriate values and click on the `Save` button to confirm the creation.
