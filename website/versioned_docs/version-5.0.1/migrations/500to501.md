# Migrate from version 5.0.0 to 5.0.1

In version 5.0.1, some changes have been made to the database. 
The `SeedData` function in the `Program.cs` file has been adapted to migrate the database from version 5.0.0 to version 5.0.1. 
Before migrating to the latest version, you must ensure that the `Program.cs` file has been properly updated link.

The following modifications have been made to the database:

* Added the `federation_entities` scope and assigned this scope to the `SIDS-Manager` client.
* Added the `SIDS-manager/administrator` scope and assigned it to the `administrator` group.
* Created the scopes for the `administrator` group.
* Added a new group `administrator` and assigned it to the Administrator user.
* Added a new group `administrator-ro` and assigned it to the new administrator-ro user.
* Added the columns `Action` and `Component` to the Scope table.

If there are realms other than `master` in your environment, you must assign the `SIDS-Manager` client to all of them. 
OPtherwise, it will not be possible to navigate through them, and you'll receive an authorization error. 
For each realm, a new record must be inserted into the table [dbo].[ClientRealm].
